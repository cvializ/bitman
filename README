PROGRAM NAME : bitman - A parser for a simple bit-manipulation grammar.

SYNOPSIS : (how to invoke the program) bitman < input.txt > outputfile.txt
  bitman takes one or more lines of input from stdin
  and prints input and results to stdout.

DESCRIPTION : (what works and what does not)
    bitman evalutates and computes any valid expression
    according to the supplied grammar. bitman, however,
    has limited error-checking capabilities and given
    malformed input it may produce incorrect output.
